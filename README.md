In the hybrid version, you are combining features from previous versions, including:

1. **Adaptive Evaporation**: Adjusting the evaporation rate to balance pheromone accumulation and dispersion.
2. **Local Search**: Adding a local search strategy to enhance the quality of solutions.
3. **Multi-Pheromone System**: Using both primary and secondary pheromone levels to influence ant decisions.
4. **Dynamic Alpha-Beta Tuning**: Adjusting `alpha` (pheromone influence) and `beta` (distance influence) based on the success of previous iterations and the pheromone entropy.
